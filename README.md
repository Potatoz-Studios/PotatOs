# Potato-Os
Before our group starts working on this, I need to mention that im a begineer in c++ and assembly (assembly, im going to learn it soon). This is merely a repository for me and my friend to later put our work in whenever im done learning mostly the basics (yeah this project is dependent on me, Since my friend is a sfx designer and artist. if you're wondering why he still is with me even tho he wont help with the code is since i can't make good well you most probably know. Sfx, ui and such). I we can't also start now since I need to also learn about hexadecimals, binary, memory, bootloaders, etc.
