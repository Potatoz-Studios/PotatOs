# PotatOs
Before our group starts working on this, I need to mention that im a beginner in c++ and assembly (im going to learn it soon). This is merely a repository for me and my friend to later put our work in whenever im done learning mostly the basics (yeah this project is dependent on me, Since my friend is a sfx designer and artist. if you're wondering why he still is with me even tho he wont help with the code is since i can't make good well you most probably know. Sfx, ui and such). We can't also start now since I need to also learn about hexadecimals, binary, memory, bootloaders, etc.

It is currently 0:54 Am, 08/11/2020 since the first edit in this text file.

Estimated month in which i will be working on it actually atleast multiple days every week: December.

Also, i will be attempting to make some few files to figure this out.

This project will seriously start someday lol.
In the mean while i might work on other projects to boost my ability/knowledge.

Some os specifications:
x86
16-bit
16 colours
