# PotatOs
02/17/2025:
Hey! Many years have passed without any updates, and this is due to really early abandonment of the project after having realized back then the true depths of OS development. 
Don't worry, we have become older, and so a basic successor to this attempted project might or might not come into development soon...

Before our group starts working on this, I need to mention that im a beginner in c++ and assembly (im going to learn it soon). This is merely a repository for me and my friend to later put our work in whenever im done learning mostly the basics (yeah this project is dependent on me, Since my friend is a sfx designer and artist. if you're wondering why he still is with me even tho he wont help with the code is since i can't make good well you most probably know. Sfx, ui and such). We can't also start now since I need to also learn about hexadecimals, binary, memory, bootloaders, etc.

It is currently 0:54 Am, 08/11/2020 since the first edit in this text file.

Estimated month in which i will be working on it actually atleast multiple days every week: December.

Also, i will be attempting to make some few files to figure this out.

This project will seriously start someday lol.
In the mean while i might work on other projects to boost my ability/knowledge.

Some os specifications:
x86
16-bit
16 colours
